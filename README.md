### ⚡ About Me

I am a backend-heavy developer with a strong foundation in **Fintech** and **Banking systems**. After years of orchestrating complex financial workflows using .NET and SQL, I am now focused on modernizing my stack and refining my approach to software craftsmanship.

* 🔭 **Currently:** Architecting personal projects with **.NET 9** and **Clean Architecture**.
* 🎨 **Exploring:** Bridging the gap between robust backends and sleek frontends using **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**.
* ⚙️ **Philosophy:** I believe software should work quietly, scale effortlessly, and remain readable for years. Complexity is an expense; clarity is an investment.
