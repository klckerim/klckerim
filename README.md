  <em>Backend-focused developer figuring things out one clean commit at a time.</em>

### 🌿 About Me
Backend-focused developer. Spent a few years in banking/fintech with .NET and SQL.  
Now I'm updating myself with more modern stacks: **.NET 9**, **Clean Architecture**, **Next.js**, **Docker**.  
I care about software that works quietly and doesn’t create drama.

---

### 🌸 What I'm doing now
- Turning my own projects into something closer to production quality  
- Improving my frontend skills where they're lacking  
- Getting clearer on architecture, clean code, and real-world patterns

### 🌿 Q&A
**What kind of work do I enjoy?**  
Straightforward, clean, maintainable projects. No unnecessary fireworks.  

**What am I learning?**  
Deepening my full-stack skills and building better backend architectures.  

**What matters most to me?**  
Writing code that future-me won't be embarrassed to read.

### 🌸 Timeline
- **2025** — Strengthening the full-stack side  
- **2020–2024** — Banking/fintech projects with .NET MVC & SQL  
- **2020** — Shifted fully into backend  
- **Before that** — Wondering if I even liked coding (apparently yes)

---

### 🌼 What I care about
- Clean code  
- Simplicity  
- Avoiding pointless complexity  
- Learning by building  

---

### 🌿 Random
I debug with coffee. No exceptions.
