# Kerim

Backend-focused developer. Spent a few years in banking/fintech with .NET and SQL.  
Now I'm updating myself with more modern stacks: .NET 9, Clean Architecture, Next.js, Docker.  
I care about software that works quietly and doesn’t create drama.

### What I'm doing now
- Turning my own projects into something closer to production quality  
- Improving my frontend skills where they're lacking  
- Getting clearer on architecture, clean code, and real-world patterns  

### Tech Stack

### Q&A
**What kind of work do I enjoy?**  
Straightforward, clean, maintainable projects. No unnecessary fireworks.  

**What am I learning?**  
Deepening my full-stack skills and building better backend architectures.  

**What matters most to me?**  
Writing code that future-me won't be embarrassed to read.

### Timeline
- **2025** — Strengthening the full-stack side  
- **2020–2024** — Banking/fintech projects with .NET MVC & SQL  
- **2020** — Shifted fully into backend  
- **Before that** — Figuring out whether I actually enjoy this thing (turns out I do)

### What I care about
- Clean code  
- Simplicity  
- Avoiding pointless complexity  
- Learning by building  

### Random
I debug with coffee. No exceptions.
